# Plan 02-04: Visual Verification Checkpoint

## Context

Human verification that Phase 2 features look and work correctly. All code is complete from Plans 02-01 through 02-03. This plan is a manual checkpoint — no code changes unless issues are found.

## Dependencies

- LIST-02: Retailer list with sortable columns
- LIST-05: Filter by status and date range
- LIST-06: Server-side pagination
- DETL-01: User detail with 5 tabs
- DETL-02: Retailer detail with 3 tabs
- DETL-05: Consistent status badges
